**multiple-disease-prediction-streamlit-app**

# Project Overview
This project is a Multiple Disease Prediction System that leverages machine learning models to predict the likelihood of various diseases, including:
- **Heart Disease**
- **Diabetes**
- **Parkinson's Disease**
- The system is designed to assist healthcare professionals and individuals in early disease detection, enabling timely medical intervention and potentially improving patient outcomes.

# Features
- **Heart Disease Prediction:** Based on various health parameters like age, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure.
- **Diabetes Prediction:** Uses factors such as glucose levels, BMI, and insulin levels.
- **Parkinson's Disease Prediction:** Uses data points related to speech and motor symptoms.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Provides an intuitive interface for inputting patient data and receiving predictions.
- **Scalable Models:** Machine learning models can be updated or extended to include more diseases.

# Technologies Used
- **Python:** Core programming language.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, etc.
- **Scikit-Learn:** For building and evaluating machine learning models.
- **Streamlit:** To deploy the prediction system as an interactive web application.
- **Pandas & Numpy:** For data manipulation and numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization.

# Getting Started
- **1.Clone the repository:** git clone https://github.com/your-username/multiple-disease-prediction.git
- **2.Install dependencies:**
Run the command below to install the required dependencies for the Streamlit app: **pip install -r requirements.txt**
- **3.Run the application:** streamlit run app.py
- **4.Access the application:** Open your web browser and go to the provided URL **(usually http://localhost:8501)**.

# Datasets
- The models are trained on publicly available datasets from trusted healthcare sources, such as the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
