Multiple disease prediction system using Machine learning

This project mainly uses machine learning concepts to predict the disease.

Requirements:
- numpy = 1.26.3
- scikit-learn = 1.3.2
- streamlit = 1.29.0
- streamlit-option-menu = 0.3.6


Steps:

- **Step 1**- Download .csv files (.csv files are the dataset)
- **Step 2**- Run the .ipynb files by reading the .csv dataset (Using Jupyter notebook and implementing in google colab)
- **Step 3**- After running the csv file, we get saved model as .sav file
- **Step 4**- Create app.py and read .sar file
- **Step 5**- Open disease_prediction.html to run the project
